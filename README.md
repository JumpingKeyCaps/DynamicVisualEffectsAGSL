This project is an ambitious Proof of Concept (PoC) aiming to explore and master the advanced capabilities of **AGSL (Android Graphics Shader Language)** to create a suite of dynamic and highly interactive visual effects on bitmaps.

The goal is to demonstrate the power of shaders combined with **touch input** and **device motion sensors** to transform a simple bitmap into an immersive and reactive visual experience.

---

## üéØ PoC Objectives

- **üß† AGSL Mastery**: Master complex fragment shaders and animation logic.
- **üñºÔ∏è Visual Quality**: Aim for realism or high stylization per effect.
- **üß© Interactivity**: Link shaders to touch + motion sensors.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Performance**: Keep smooth framerate, minimize costly ops.
- **üîß Modularity**: Easily combine or add new shader effects.

---

## üîß Technologies & Tools

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose  
- AGSL shader (android 13+ only)
- RuntimeShader / ShaderBrush
- Coroutines and State management for animation and interaction  
- Math & trigonometry for wave modeling  

---

## üöÄ Implemented / In Progress Features

This PoC is structured around four major graphic effects, each designed to be manipulated by specific interactions.

---

### 1. üíß Water Effect *(Implemented)*

Simulates realistic ripples and refractions on a bitmap using a dynamic AGSL shader.

- **Shader logic**: Custom fragment shader deforms UVs based on a blend of up to 16 circular waves. Each wave is defined by center, amplitude, frequency, damping, and age.
  
- **Visual result**: The bitmap appears as a fluid surface, with natural-looking water ripples radiating from touch points. Deformations decay over time for smooth fading.
  
- **User interaction**: Touch or drag to spawn ripples. Multi-touch is fully supported ‚Äî each gesture creates a separate wave. Wave parameters (amplitude, radius, decay) can be tuned.
  
- **Animation model**: Wave state is tracked in Compose and updated via `withFrameNanos`. Old waves are purged when their lifespan ends. The shader reacts in real-time.
  
- **Component design**: `WaterEffectComposable` wraps the canvas, touch handler, and shader logic cleanly. The system is modular, reactive, and ready for reuse or combination with other effects.

### 2. üåà Holographic Effects *(In Development)*

Simulates holographic foil and rainbow diffraction effects with dynamic light refraction.

- **Technical**:
  - Angle-dependent rainbow gradients with smooth UV shifts.
  - Layered noise + sine waves to mimic diffraction patterns.
  - Specular highlights and subtle distortion for depth.
- **Interaction**:
  - Sensor-based view angle controls gradient movement.
  - Touch creates shimmering pulses or rainbow flashes.

---

### 3. üíæ Distortion & Glitch Art *(Coming Soon)*

Creates digital-style visual noise like chromatic aberration, glitches, and heat waves.

- **Technical**:
  - **Chromatic aberration**: shift RGB channels via UV offsets.
  - **Glitch**: block-based displacement, color inversion, static noise.
  - **Heat waves**: soft animated UV warping using noise.
- **Interaction**:
  - Reacts to **tilt/shake/tap** (accelerometer & gyroscope).
  - Shake = glitch bursts, tilt = continuous distortion.
 
#### Distortion Shaders Tasks

- **Distortion Effects**:
  - RGB offsets per channel (chromatic aberration).
  - Glitch: UV jumps, color noise triggered by motion thresholds.

### 4. ‚ú® Luminous & Energy Effects *(Coming Soon)*

Simulates plasma, shimmering aura, and iridescence like soap bubbles or oil on water.

- **Technical**:
  - **Iridescence**: Thin-film interference using angle-dependent color gradients.
  - **Plasma/Aura**: Mix of noise + trig for energy visuals.
- **Interaction**:
  - Sensor-based view angle affects colors.
  - Touch emits pulses or light bursts.
 
#### Iridescence Shaders Tasks

- **Iridescence Effects**:
  - Compute view direction from gyro.
  - Use dot product or trig mapping to modulate color spectrum.

### 5. üî• Fire Effect *(Coming Soon)*

Generates realistic procedural flames that progressively "burn" and consume the bitmap.

- **Technical**:
  - Perlin/Simplex noise = organic flame shapes.
  - Dynamic color mapping: bright yellow ‚Üí deep red ‚Üí ash tones.
  - Fire propagation based on time + distance from ignition.
  - Alpha reduction & pixel burn simulation.

  - Tune scale/frequency.
- **Color Mapping**:
  - Intensity ‚Üí RGBA function (fire palette).
- **Propagation Logic**:
  - `fire = noise + (uv.y - y0) * speed - time`.
  - Reduce alpha where fire intensity is high.
- **Animation**:
  - Link all motion to `u_time` for continuity.

### 6. ‚ö° Electric Sparks & Lightning *(Coming Soon)*

Generates stylized lightning bolts and crackling energy sparks across the screen.

- **Technical**:
  - Ray effect: Animate noise-based jagged lines from origin point.
  - Glow pulse: Use radial blur for glow around spark lines.
  - Flash animation: Sync light pulses with strike origin.
- **Interaction**:
