This project is an ambitious Proof of Concept (PoC) aiming to explore and master the advanced capabilities of **AGSL (Android Graphics Shader Language)** to create a suite of dynamic and highly interactive visual effects on bitmaps.

The goal is to demonstrate the power of shaders combined with **touch input** and **device motion sensors** to transform a simple bitmap into an immersive and reactive visual experience.

---

## üéØ PoC Objectives

- **üß† AGSL Mastery**: Master complex fragment shaders and animation logic.
- **üñºÔ∏è Visual Quality**: Aim for realism or high stylization per effect.
- **üß© Interactivity**: Link shaders to touch + motion sensors.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Performance**: Keep smooth framerate, minimize costly ops.
- **üîß Modularity**: Easily combine or add new shader effects.

---

## üîß Technologies & Tools

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose  
- AGSL shader (android 13+ only)
- RuntimeShader / ShaderBrush
- Coroutines and State management for animation and interaction  
- Math & trigonometry for wave modeling  

---

## üöÄ Implemented / In Progress Features

This PoC is structured around four major graphic effects, each designed to be manipulated by specific interactions.

---

### 1. üíß Water Effect *(Implemented)*

Simulates realistic ripples and refractions on a bitmap using a dynamic AGSL shader.

- **Shader logic**: Custom fragment shader deforms UVs based on a blend of up to 16 circular waves. Each wave is defined by center, amplitude, frequency, damping, and age.
  
- **Visual result**: The bitmap appears as a fluid surface, with natural-looking water ripples radiating from touch points. Deformations decay over time for smooth fading.
  
- **User interaction**: Touch or drag to spawn ripples. Multi-touch is fully supported ‚Äî each gesture creates a separate wave. Wave parameters (amplitude, radius, decay) can be tuned.
  
- **Animation model**: Wave state is tracked in Compose and updated via `withFrameNanos`. Old waves are purged when their lifespan ends. The shader reacts in real-time.
  
- **Component design**: `WaterEffectComposable` wraps the canvas, touch handler, and shader logic cleanly. The system is modular, reactive, and ready for reuse or combination with other effects.

### 2. üåà Holographic Effect - Real-Time / Sensor-Driven *(Implemented)*

Simulates a dynamic holographic foil effect, with angle-sensitive iridescence, rainbow interference patterns, and chromatic distortion ‚Äî all modulated in real time by the device‚Äôs physical orientation.

#### üß™ Technical Highlights:

 - Procedural iridescence using multi-layered FBM noise and enhanced HSV rainbow mapping.

 - Surface normals are perturbed with fine micro-details to create realistic light interference zones.

 - Fresnel modulation enhances realism by increasing brightness at glancing angles.

 - Dynamic chromatic aberration adds subtle color shift based on device tilt roll.

 - Realtime device tilt input (pitch/roll) drives view-dependent shimmer and distortion.

 - Darkness-based masking ensures the effect appears only in low-luminance areas (e.g., shadowed or black ink zones).


#### üß† Interaction Design:

 - Reacts to device orientation (pitch & roll) via TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR sensor.

 - Fully GPU-based with no bitmap mutation ‚Äî can be applied live on images, cards or backgrounds.

 - All parameters (intensity, relief, color scale‚Ä¶) are externally controllable via Composables.

`Ideal for mimicking collectible card effects, stickers, security patterns, or oil-slick-like visuals`

### 3. üíæ Distortion & Glitch Art *(Coming Soon)*

Creates digital-style visual noise like chromatic aberration, glitches, and heat waves.

- **Technical**:
  - **Chromatic aberration**: shift RGB channels via UV offsets.
  - **Glitch**: block-based displacement, color inversion, static noise.
  - **Heat waves**: soft animated UV warping using noise.
- **Interaction**:
  - Reacts to **tilt/shake/tap** (accelerometer & gyroscope).
  - Shake = glitch bursts, tilt = continuous distortion.
 
#### Distortion Shaders Tasks

- **Distortion Effects**:
  - RGB offsets per channel (chromatic aberration).
  - Glitch: UV jumps, color noise triggered by motion thresholds.

### 4. ‚ú® Luminous & Energy Effects *(Coming Soon)*

Simulates plasma, shimmering aura, and iridescence like soap bubbles or oil on water.

- **Technical**:
  - **Iridescence**: Thin-film interference using angle-dependent color gradients.
  - **Plasma/Aura**: Mix of noise + trig for energy visuals.
- **Interaction**:
  - Sensor-based view angle affects colors.
  - Touch emits pulses or light bursts.
 
#### Iridescence Shaders Tasks

- **Iridescence Effects**:
  - Compute view direction from gyro.
  - Use dot product or trig mapping to modulate color spectrum.

---

### 5. üî• Fire Effect *(Coming Soon)*

Generates realistic procedural flames that progressively "burn" and consume the bitmap.

- **Technical**:
  - Perlin/Simplex noise = organic flame shapes.
  - Dynamic color mapping: bright yellow ‚Üí deep red ‚Üí ash tones.
  - Fire propagation based on time + distance from ignition.
  - Alpha reduction & pixel burn simulation.
- **Interaction**:
  - Long-press or swipe-up to ignite.
  - Intensity/speed controlled by gesture frequency or pressure.
 
####  Fire Shader Tasks

- **Noise Integration**:
  - Use Perlin/Simplex (inline or pre-generated).
  - Tune scale/frequency.
- **Color Mapping**:
  - Intensity ‚Üí RGBA function (fire palette).
- **Propagation Logic**:
  - `fire = noise + (uv.y - y0) * speed - time`.
  - Reduce alpha where fire intensity is high.
- **Animation**:
  - Link all motion to `u_time` for continuity.

### 6. ‚ö° Electric Sparks & Lightning *(Coming Soon)*

Generates stylized lightning bolts and crackling energy sparks across the screen.

- **Technical**:
  - Ray effect: Animate noise-based jagged lines from origin point.
  - Glow pulse: Use radial blur for glow around spark lines.
  - Flash animation: Sync light pulses with strike origin.
- **Interaction**:
  - Tap to emit spark.
  - Shake triggers bigger lightning strike + screen flash.

- **Technical**:  
  - UV remapping for fisheye/pincushion distortion.  
  - Animated scanlines and vignette.  
  - RGB channel offset for chromatic aberration.  
  - Optional glow or blur for phosphorescent look.

- **Interaction**:  
  - Triggered by tap/tilt/shake.
